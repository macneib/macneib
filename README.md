### About me

* Mostly comfortable with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* Constantly studying [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) are a way of life.
* So is yaml...
* Also studying studying [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/)
* Quietly obsessed with messaging systems such as [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
* Background in webrtc, freeswitch, telephony in general.
* My strongest opinion: You probably need more [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) in your life.
* The coolest thing I learned about in 2020 was [NX](https://nx.dev/)
